# Year on Github üêô

[![Heroku App Status](http://heroku-shields.herokuapp.com/my-year-on-github)](http://gh2020.jrieke.com)

**Share your Github stats for 2020 on Twitter.**

This project contains a small web app that let's you share stats about your Github 
activity from last year. It's like Spotify's "year in review" but for Github. The app 
is built with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/), queries Github's API via 
[ghapi](https://ghapi.fast.ai/), and let's you share the generated stats directly on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/).

## Installation

**Note: Only required if you want to work on the app. If you just want to use it, go [here](http://gh2020.jrieke.com/).**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrieke/my-year-on-github.git
cd my-year-on-github
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Known issues**

- **Doesn't work with Python 3.8 and 3.9!** Both versions throw an error related to 
  ghapi/multiprocessing that I couldn't resolve yet 
  (`RuntimeError: An attempt has been made to start a new process before the current process has finished its bootstrapping phase` 
  and subsequently an `EOFError`). Please use Python 3.7 for now.

- [ghapi](https://ghapi.fast.ai/) has (as of 26 December 2020) a small bug in the 
  `paged` method (see [here](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi/issues/24)), which may 
  cause problems, therefore the commands above will install it from 
  [my fork](https://github.com/jrieke/ghapi) (you can also install it manually from 
  there with `pip install -U git+https://github.com/jrieke/ghapi`).


## Running locally

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Make sure to run always from the `my-year-on-github` dir (not from the `app `dir), 
otherwise the app will not be able to find the css file.
